## üåü **Project Goal**

The **Crisp AI Interview Assistant** is a dual-interface application designed to streamline the technical interview process for **Full-Stack (React/Node)** roles. It provides a real-time, timed interview experience for candidates and a comprehensive evaluation dashboard for interviewers. **All data is persisted locally** using state management for a seamless and uninterrupted user experience.

---

## ‚ú® **Core Features**

The application is structured into two main, synchronized tabs:

### üë§ **Interviewee Tab (Chat)**

* **Resume Parsing (PDF/DOCX):** Candidates can upload their resume, from which the system automatically extracts **Name, Email, and Phone Number**.
* **Data Validation:** If any essential contact field is missing, the **Crisp AI** chatbot intelligently prompts the candidate to provide it before the interview begins.
* **Timed Interview Simulation:** A structured, dynamic, and timed technical interview based on the selected role (e.g., Full-Stack).
* **Welcome Back Modal:** If a session is unfinished, a modal appears on reload to offer a **pause/resume** option, ensuring progress is never lost.

### üìä **Interviewer Tab (Dashboard)**

* **Candidate List:** A sortable and searchable list of all candidates, ordered by their final **Crisp AI**-generated score.
* **Detailed View:** Ability to click on any candidate to view a detailed breakdown of their:
    * Complete **Chat History** (Questions and Answers).
    * Extracted **Profile Details**.
    * **Final AI Summary** and Score.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Interview Flow**

The **Crisp AI**-driven interview follows a strict, progressive format:

| Phase | **Number of Questions** | **Difficulty** | **Time Limit per Question** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Phase 1** | 2 | **Easy** | **20 seconds** |
| **Phase 2** | 2 | **Medium** | **60 seconds** |
| **Phase 3** | 2 | **Hard** | **120 seconds** |

* **Total Questions:** 6
* **Automatic Submission:** When the timer runs out, the current answer is automatically submitted, and the system moves to the next question.
* **Final Assessment:** After the 6th question, **Crisp AI** calculates a **final score** and generates a concise, insightful **summary** of the candidate's performance.
